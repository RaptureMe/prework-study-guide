# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- My motivation in creating this was to make me more knowledgeable about coding so that I am more proficient in my learning process.
- I created this Prework Study Guide Webpage to get me prepared for the inensity of the upcoming Bootcamp I am enrolled in.
- I solved the problem of having no understanding of coding coming in the Bootcamp.
- I learned a basic understanding of the structure of HTML, how to use VScode, and how to implement CSS and JS into my site.
